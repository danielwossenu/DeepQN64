# Nidoran Stat Requirements

### Overview

We catch Nidoran at level 6 on Route 2 before entering Viridian Forest (level 4's are not acceptable for the route). After defeating the first trainer, Nidoran reaches level 8, and we can check its stats definitively.

### Requirements

The current requirements are **15** attack, **14** speed, **12** special.

### Probability

The following is the probability of a Nidoran stats being acceptable at level 8. Equations are written as: probability of each *Attack* x *Speed* x *Special* multiplied together.

Chance of a **15+ attack, 14+ speed, 12+ special** Nidoran: 11/16 x 10/16 x 12/16 = 0.322265625 â‰ˆ **32%**
